# Unity.ErrorAlerts

Never miss an error again!

This simple, lightweight, and 100% free Unity asset will save you and your team hours.

**When an error is encountered, a wav plays.**
...I know.

Tested with Unity 2017.  Works with both the old compiler and Unity's new C# 6 / .NET 4.6 support.


## Install Instructions

 - Download [Unity.ErrorAlerts Zip](TODO)
 - Unzip into your Project's Asset directory.

That's it!


Optionally change the sound effect by replacing the file:

  - Assets\HardlyDifficult\Unity.ErrorAlerts\Editor\Resources\HardlyDifficult.Unity.ErrorAlertSound.wav

Note:

 - There is absolutely NO impact on your final build.  The wav file and script are both Editor only.
